        **Posting Data Source Access and Limits**


        There are two types of posting data that clients can have access to; Lightcast-source
        posting data, and non-Lightcast-source. Give `postings:early_feed_access`
        claim of type scope to a client to grant access to Lightcast-source posting
        data.


        To restrict their access to only expired posting data, give `postings:only_expired_samples`
        claim.


        By default all clients can view up to a total of 10 postings. The limit can
        be changed through a `postings:samples_full_access` claim. The claim `postings:samples_full_access`
        alone increases the total limit to 100 postings. To increase the limit to
        1000, grant `postings:samples_full_access:1000`.

                  has been active. This filter differs from the 'posting_duration'
                  metric in that it will take into account currently active posting
                  durations, where the metric only calculates duration of expired
                  postings.
